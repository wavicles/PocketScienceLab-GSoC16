##Voltammetry

Voltammetry is the study of current as a function of applied potential. These curves I = f(E) are called voltammograms. 

The potential is varied arbitrarily either step by step or continuously, and the actual current value is measured as the dependent variable.
The shape of the curves depends on the speed of potential variation (nature of driving force) and on whether the solution is stirred or quiescent (mass transfer). Most experiments control the potential (volts) of an electrode in contact with the analyte while measuring the resulting current (amperes).

ExpEYES can be used for these measurements and the cost of the equipment can be reduced considerably.


As a part of GSoC 2016 project we have planned to develope a  complete module for voltametric measurements. Since ExpEYES doesn't have a bipolar voltage source, we need to convert unipolar voltage to bipolar using external circuit. The GUI will have necessary controls for voltage sweeping. 

There are various types of based on the way voltage sweep is carried out.

Linear sweep voltammetry
Staircase voltammetry
Squarewave voltammetry
Cyclic voltammetry 


We are trying to have all these options in this module.
